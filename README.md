LED Blinking on STM32F427IIH6 Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to blink LEDs using the STM32F427IIH6 microcontroller. The project is set up using STM32CubeMX for peripheral configuration and STM32CubeIDE for coding and building.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to configure the GPIOs of the STM32F427IIH6 microcontroller to toggle an LED. This serves as a foundational project to get familiar with the STM32F4 series and embedded systems development.

Features
Microcontroller: STM32F427IIH6
IDE: STM32CubeIDE
Peripherals: GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
Tool: STM32CubeMX for peripheral initialization
Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: STM32F427IIH6-based development board
One or more LEDs
Resistors (typically 220 ohms)
Breadboard and jumper wires (if needed)
Software Requirements
STM32CubeIDE
STM32CubeMX
Project Setup
STM32CubeMX Configuration:

Configure the GPIO pin connected to the LED as an output.
Enable the system clock and other necessary peripherals.
Generate the initialization code for STM32CubeIDE for the STM32F427IIH6.
STM32CubeIDE:

Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
Write the code to toggle the LED in the main.c file using HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) functions.
Build and flash the code to the STM32F427IIH6 microcontroller.
Code Explanation
The main code for toggling the LED is written in Core/Src/main.c:

c
Copy code
while (1)
{
    HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOx, GPIO_PIN_x);  // Replace GPIOx and GPIO_PIN_x with your specific configuration
    HAL_Delay(500);  // Delay in milliseconds
}
This loop continuously toggles the GPIO pin connected to the LED with a delay, creating the blinking effect.

How to Run the Project
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MahadiAlif/LED_blinking_in_stm32.git
